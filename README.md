## 👋Hi there, I'm Jenny

### PhD Candidate in Mathematical Optimization

I recently submitted my PhD thesis in mathematics at [Research Area Discrete Optimization](https://www.math2.rwth-aachen.de/en/home), RWTH Aachen and am now looking to transition into industry roles where I can combine analytical thinking with practical computational skills.

My GitHub is where I build and showcase projects that reflect my background:

- 🧮 mathematical insight
- 📊 computational modeling
- 💡 personal projects that explore ideas I’m genuinely curious about

### 🧑‍💻 What I code with:

### 🧠 Academic Background

During my PhD, I focused on mathematical optimization, specifically discrete and robust optimization to help make good decisions even when the data is uncertain.
Among others, I investigated a robust variant of the b-matching problem, and an integrated timetabling and electric vehicle scheduling problem for electric buses.
